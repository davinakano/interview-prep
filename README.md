# interview-prep

Doing all the boring interview-like coding questions with multiple programming languages.

## Motivation

Enough is enough. I am tired of being afraid of technical interviews that involve the dreaded "whiteboard" coding questions.
Personally, I still disagree with the current interview style that most companies (in my experience) still use but unfortunately I do not hold the power to change this. I wholeheartedly prefer to have a more true-to-life take-home-project without all the pressure and anxiety.

Therefore, I will keep this repository just so I can store such questions and answers. Maybe it will not be the most optimal solution but I figure that the best way to know is to actually put it on the Internet since there are tons of people that are smarter than me out there that are ready to point out improvements / mistakes.

## Project structure

Everything is under `src/`. Inside of it, there are (or will be) folders with the programming languages that I am most comfortable with or studying at the moment. Nested, the problems will be separated by "major topic" such as `strings` or `dataStructures`.

Hopefully I can keep up updating this as a way to be ready, lock 'n loaded!

## How to run the projects

For Javascript, have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (latest LTS is just fine) and run:

`$ node src/javascript/PROBLEM_CATEGORY/01.js`

For C#, there are console apps created with [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (latest version is just fine). You can run then by typing:

`$ dotnet run --project src/csharp/PROBLEM_CATEGORY/01`
